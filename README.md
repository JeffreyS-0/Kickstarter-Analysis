# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. 
## Overview 
Louise has contracted me out to complete an analysis of the recent Theater and Play Kickstarter Campaigns. 
The purpose behind this analysis is to give Louise a better understanding of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
Louise came really close to meeting her fundraising goal for her play "Fever". However, her play ultimately failed. Louise would like to learn from any mistakes she had and would like to see how other campaigns managed to reach their goals.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The months of the year  are correlating with successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns. 
To help visualize these findings, you can refer to the line chart below. Campaigns are failed and canceled at a pretty steady rate throughout the year. However, you do see that the beginning of the new year sparks an interest in theater campaigns and reaches a peak in the month of May, and for the rest of the year that interest slowly dies away.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here we wanted to see what the percentage of the theater-play campaigns were successful, failed or canceled; and if the Goal of these campaigns had any correlation with them succeeding, failing or being canceled.
It's interesting to see that for the most part, as the Goal increased, the less likely the campaign was going to be successful.![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69607218/130504843-c05cf935-9332-46e8-8a89-ca959fed6d94.png)
## Challenges and Difficulties
The biggest challenge I had while completing this analysis was when I downloaded the dataset for the first time. I hade made it halfway through my analysis when I realized that the Goal and Pledged $ of the Theater section was slightly off and the number of Successful, Failed and Canceled Theater campaigns were off. The total number of Kickstarter campaigns and the data relating to ever other category was the same, the only thing off was the Theater section. I had to re-download the dataset and work through the analysis all over again.
## Results
### Conclusions from Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
  1. May and June are the best months of the year to hold a theater Kickstarter campaign.
  2. The chance of the theater campaign being canceled is almost negligible. 

### Conclusion from Outcomes Based on Goals
  - The most 'Plays' campaigns that were successful were in the <$1000 bracket or the $1000 - $4999 range; with 75.81% and 72.66% success rates respectively.

The dataset is specifically limited to Kickstarter campaigns within the years of 2009 and 2017. There are other crowdfunding websites out there, like Indiegogo and Patreon, that could have a different outcome.

If you are interested in getting any more information out of the dataset, you could create a table filtered to see if specific countries are more likely to have a higher success rate to 'Theater' campaigns. When visualizing this kind of data, I would reccommend you use a stack column graph.
